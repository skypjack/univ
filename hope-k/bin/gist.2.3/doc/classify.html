<P><B>Description:</B> Classify a set of unlabeled vectors using a
trained support vector machine.

<P><B>Usage:</B> <CODE>gist-classify [options] -train&nbsp;&lt;filename&gt;
-learned&nbsp;&lt;filename&gt; -test&nbsp;&lt;filename&gt;</CODE>

<P><B>Input:</B> 
<UL> 

<LI> -train &lt;filename&gt; - a tab-delimited file of training
examples.  The first column contains labels, and the remaining columns
contain real-valued features.  Missing values are not allowed.

<LI> -learned &lt;filename&gt; - a file of weights, as output from
<CODE>compute-weights</CODE>.  The kernel parameters are read from the
header of this file.

<LI> -test &lt;filename&gt; - a tab-delimited file of test examples
to be classified.  Missing values are not allowed.
</UL>

<p>Note that, if the given weights file was trained on an externally
defined kernel (using the '-matrix' option to
<CODE>compute-weights</CODE>), then the file specified by the '-test'
option should contain a kernel matrix, rather than test set examples.
The kernel matrix is an n+1 (rows) by m+1 (columns) matrix, where n is
the number of test examples and m is the number of training examples.
The first row and column contain data labels.  The matrix entry for
row x, column y, contains the kernel value K(x,y).  If a kernel matrix
is supplied in place of the test set, then a training set should not
be specified.  However, if the kernel is normalized or is radial
basis, then the '-selftrain' and '-selftest' files must be supplied
(see below).</p>


<P><B>Output:</B> A three-column file containing data labels,
classifications (-1 or 1) and discriminants for the test set.

<P><B>Options:</B>
<UL>

<LI> -selftrain &lt;filename&gt; - Read from the given file a series
of n values of the form K(x,x), where K is the base kernel function
and x is an element in the training set.  This option is only
necessary if the base kernel matrix is supplied from a file (using the
-matrix option in <CODE>compute-weights</CODE>) and the kernel is
normalized or radial basis.  The input file should be in tab-delimited
format, with titles in the first row, data labels in the first column
and values in the second column.

<LI> -selftest &lt;filename&gt; - Similar to '-selftrain', but for the
test set. This option is only needed if you used the -matrix option in
<CODE>compute-weights</CODE>.

<LI> -rdb - Allow the program to read and create <A
HREF="http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/research/compbio/rdb/index.html">RDB</A>
formatted files, which contain an additional format line after the
first line of text.

<LI> -kernelout - Compute and print the kernel matrix to stdout.  Do
not compute the classifications.

<LI> -notime - Do not include timing information in the output header.

<LI> -precision &lt;value&gt; - Number of digits after the decimal
place in the output file.  The default is 6.

<LI> -verbose 1|2|3|4|5 - Set the verbosity level of the output to
stderr.  The default level is 2.
</UL>
