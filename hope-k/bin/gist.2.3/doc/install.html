			<h3>Binary distributions</h3>
			<p>You will have downloaded a file that has a name something like &quot;gist.2.3.$ARCH.tar.gz&quot;, where $ARCH is a string describing your architecture (such as Linuxi686). Unzip and de-tar the distribution file as follows:</p>
			<PRE>
     gunzip -c gist.2.3.Linuxi686.tar.gz | tar xvf - 
			</PRE>
or
			<PRE>
     tar -zxf gist.2.3.Linuxi686.tar.gz 
			</PRE>

			<p>The binaries are found in the 'bin'
			directory. (Note to previous users of Gist: In
			version 2.3, the compiled C executables are no
			longer in an $ARCH subdirectory of bin).
				<P>
					Once you have the program binaries available, you will need to either copy these executables into your path (e.g., /usr/local/bin) or add the following lines to your .cshrc or .login file (where 'path-root' is the location where you installed Gist): 
					<PRE>
     setenv ARCH `uname -ms | tr -d ' '` set path = ($path path-root/gist.2.3/bin) 
					</PRE>
					<H3>
						Building from source
					</H3>
					
				</P>
			</p>
			<p>Generic instructions are found in the INSTALL file that comes with the source distribution. The key steps are reiterated here.</p>
			<p>First unpack the distribution, e.g. &quot;gist-2.3.tar.gz&quot;, as above. Then:</p>
			<pre>
cd gist.2.3
./configure
make
make install
</pre>
			<p>If you want the gist executables to install in a particular place (the usual default is /usr/local/bin), you can run the configure script as follows:</p>
			<pre>
./configure --bindir=/absolute/path/to/desired/dir
</pre>
			<p>where <code>/absolute/path/to/desired/dir</code> is where you want the executables to go.</p>
