<p><b>Description:</B> Perform various matrix manipulations on
matrices in RDB or white-space delimited format.

<P><B>Usage:</B> <code>gist-matrix -matrix1 &lt;filename&gt; [-matrix2
&lt;filename&gt;]</code>

<P><B>Input:</B> 
<UL> 

<li> -matrix1 &lt;filename&gt; - a tab-delimited matrix file
containing floating point values, with labels in the first row and
column.

<li> -matrix2 &lt;filename&gt; - similar to matrix1.  This option is
only necessary for some of the operations listed below.
</UL>

<P><B>Output:</B> Write to standard output the result of performing
the requested operation on the given matrix or matrices.  The output
is in the same format as the input.</P>

<P><B>Options:</B>

<UL>

<li> -operation &lt;option&gt; Specify the operation to be performed on the
given matrix or matrices.  These include the following:
<UL>

<li>
none - Do not modify the matrix.

<li>
size - Print the dimensions of the matrix, row by column.

<li>
randomize - Fill the matrix with random numbers between 0 and 1.

<li>
covariance - Compute the covariance matrix.

<li>
square - Multiply the matrix by itself (must be a square matrix).

<li>
invert - Invert the matrix (must be a square matrix).

<li>
binarize - Convert all entries in the matrix to -1 if less than a
given threshold value, 1 otherwise.

<li>
transpose - Transpose the matrix.

<li>
eigenvectors - Compute the eigenvectors of the given matrix (must
be symmetric across the diagonal).

<li>
eigenvalues - Compute the eigenvalues of the given matrix (must
be symmetric across the diagonal).

<li>
eigenvector1 - Compute only the first eigenvector of the given matrix
(symmetry not required).

<li>
symdiag - Symmetrize the matrix by averaging across the diagonal.

<li>
adddiag - Add a given value (specified using the -value option) to the
diagonal of the matrix.

<li>
getrowsums - Extract the row sums.

<li>
getcolsums - Extract the column sums.

<li>
getdiag - Extract the diagonal of the matrix.

<li>
add - Add two matrices together (requires -matrix2 option).

<li>
normalizerow - Compute the sum of each row in a given matrix, and
divide each entry in the matrix by the sum.  If matrix2 is given, then
the division is carried out on that matrix.

<li>
normalizecol - Same as normalizerow, but works vertically.

<li>
rescalerow - Linearly rescale the values in each row so that the
minimum is -1 and the maximum is 1.

<li>
rescalecol - Same as previous, but for columns.

<li>
normalize - Iteratively normalize the matrix rows and columns so that
they sum to 1.0.

<li>
zeromeanrow - Set the mean of each row in the matrix to zero.

<li>
zeromeancol - Set the mean of each column in the matrix to zero.

<li>
varone - Set the variance of each row in the matrix to one.

<li>
colvars - Compute the variance of each column.

<li>
scalarmult - Multiply the matrix by a scalar value (specified via the
-value option).

<li>
dotmult - Multiply corresponding entries in two matrices of the
same dimensionality.

<li>
posdef - Force a symmetric matrix to be positive definite by
adding to the diagonal the opposite of the smallest eigenvalue.

<li>
row-correlation - Compute all pairwise correlations between rows in a
matrix.  Admits a second, optional argument to compute correlations
between rows in one matrix and rows in a second.

<li>
col-correlation - Compute all pairwise correlations between columns in a
matrix.  Like the previous option, admits a second matrix.

<li>
jacard - Compute all pairwise Jacard similarities between rows in a
matrix.  The Jacard similarity is J(X,Y) = \sum
min(X<sub>i</sub>/Y<sub>I</sub>, Y<sub>i</sub>/X<sub>I</sub>)

<li>
shuffle - Randomly shuffle the entries in the matrix.

<li>
alignment - Compute the alignment score between two square
matrices of the same dimensionality.  This score is &lt;M1,M2&gt; /
\sqrt(&lt;M1,M1&gt; &lt;M2,M2&gt;).

<li>
diagonal - Compute the alignment score between a given matrix and
the corresponding diagonal matrix (i.e., the matrix with zeroes for
off-diagonal elements and ones for diagonal elements).

<li>
label-align - Compute the alignment score between a given matrix
and a label matrix that is created from a given label file.  The label
file (which is specified using the <code>-matrix2</code> option), must
be a two-column file, of the type used by
<code>compute-weights</code>, with labels of 1 and -1.  The program
multiplies the label column by its transpose and then calculates the
alignment between the given matrix (specified by <code>-matrix</code>
and the square label matrix.

<li>
scalediag - Take a square matrix as input, and replace the
diagonal elements with the sum of each row, minus the given diagonal
element.

<li>
euclidean - Convert a square kernel matrix to the corresponding matrix
of Euclidean distances.

<li>
center - Center a given kernel in feature space.  The second kernel is
centered using feature means from the first kernel.  The first kernel
must be square, and the second must have the same columns as the
first.

<li>
setdiag - Set the entries on the diagonal of a given square matrix to a
given value.

<li>
diffusion - Perform a diffusion operation on the given symmetric
matrix, using the specified value as the diffusion constant.

<li>
euclidean - Convert a square kernel matrix to a Euclidean distance
matrix using d(x,y) = sqrt(k(x,x) - 2k(x,y) + k(y,y)).

<li>
int-dim - Estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of a square kernel
matrix.  This is done by converting the kernel to a Euclidean distance
matrix, and then computing the squared mean inter-object distance
divided by the corresponding variance.

<li>
modav - Compute the mean off-diagonal absolute value in a square matrix.

</ul>

<li>
-width &lt;value&gt; - Total number of digits in each output
value.

<li>
-precision &lt;value&gt; - Number of digits to the right of zero
in each output value.

<li>
-value &lt;value&gt; - Specify a value to be used in the matrix
operation.  When normalizing, this value is the precision to which the
normalization is carried.  With "adddiag," this value is the number to
be added to the diagonal of the given matrix. With "scalarmult," it is
the scalar value to multiply the matrix by.

<li>
-seed &lt;value&gt; - Set the seed for the random number
generator.  By default the seed is set from the clock.  The random
number generator is only used in conjunction with the "normalize"
option.

<li>
-raw - Do not require on input (or produce on output) labels on
each row and column.  Also, use space delimiters rather than tabs
between entries.

<li>
-rdb - Allow the program to read and create <A
HREF="http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/research/compbio/rdb/index.html">RDB</A>
formatted files, which contain an additional format line after the
first line of text.

<li>
-verbose 1|2|3|4|5 - Set the verbosity level of the output to
stderr.  The default level is 2.

</UL>

<P><B>Bugs:</B> Very little checking of command line arguments is
performed.</P>
