<P><B>Description:</B> Select features from a given data set based
upon a specified measure of feature quality. Usually you will also
want to set the threshold for the measure you select using the
-fthreshold option.</p>

<P><B>Usage:</B> gist-fselect [options] &lt;labels&gt; &lt;primary&gt;
&lt;secondary&gt;

<P><B>Input:</B> 
<UL> 

<LI> &lt;labels&gt; - a multi-column, tab-delimited file of
classification labels.  This file must contain exactly the same number
of lines as the training data file.  The first column contains labels,
which must appear in the same order as in the primary data file
(though this is not checked for by the program).  The second and
subsequent columns contain binary classifications for each label (1
for positive examples, -1 or 0 for negatives). The classification
column used from this file is the first one by default; subsequent
columns can be used by invoking the -useclassnumber option described
below.

<LI> &lt;primary&gt; - a tab-delimited matrix file containing strings
in the first row and column, and floating point values in the rest of
the matrix.  Each row in the primary data file corresponds to one row
in the label file.

<LI> &lt;secondary&gt; - similar to &lt;primary&gt;.  The two files
must have the same number of features but may have different numbers
of rows.
</UL>


<P><B>Output:</B> Chooses a subset of features from the primary data
matrix using a given quality metric.  Writes to standard output a
version of the secondary data matrix in which low-quality columns have
been removed.</P>

<P><B>Options:</B>

<UL>


<LI>
-metric fisher|ttest|welch|mannwhitney|sam|tnom - Specify the
metric used to evaluate individual features.
<UL>
<LI>
The Fisher criterion score is (m<SUB>1</SUB> -
m<SUB>2</SUB>)<SUP>2</SUP> / (v<SUB>1</SUB> + v<SUB>2</SUB>), where
m<SUB>i</SUB> and v<SUB>i</SUB> are the mean and variance of the given
feature in class i.
<LI>
The standard t-test is |m<SUB>1</SUB> - m<SUB>2</SUB>| /
sqrt((v/n<SUB>1</SUB>) + (v/n<SUB>2</SUB>)), where n<SUB>i</SUB> is
the number of examples in class i, and v is the pooled variance across
both classes.  The score is reported as a negative log<SUB>10</SUB>
p-value.
<LI>
Welch's approximate t-test is |m<SUB>1</SUB> - m<SUB>2</SUB>| /
sqrt((v<SUB>1</SUB>/n<SUB>1</SUB>) + (v<SUB>2</SUB>/n<SUB>2</SUB>)).
The score is reported as a negative log<SUB>10</SUB> p-value.
<LI>
The Mann-Whitney test is a nonparametric test.  The Student's t-test
is used to break ties.  The score is reported as a negative
log<SUB>10</SUB> p-value.

<LI>
The SAM metric is adapted from the "Signficance analysis of
microarrays" method developed by Tusher et al (Proc Natl Acad Sci U S
A 2001 Apr 24;98(9):5116-21). SAM uses the calculation method
described in detail in the SAM user manual (Chu et al.). Our
implementation of SAM is currently only partial, in that it only
calculates the raw statistic for ranking genes, without calculation of
error rates at particular score cutoffs.

<!--, while SAMF
implements a faster heuristic method which is described in a tech
report "Microarrays and their use in a comparative experiment" (Efron
et al.). SAMF is about five times faster than SAM, and results in a
significant speed up during hold-one-out cross-validation experiments.
-->
<LI>
The threshold number of misclassifications (tnom) method is adapted
from "Tissue Classification of Gene Expression Profiles" (Ben-dor et
al., Journal of Computational Biology 7 pp 559-583 (200)). It is a
nonparametric method based on "decision stumps". Our implementation of
tnom is currently only partial in that only raw scores, not p-values,
are calculated. This provides a ranking of the genes but cannot be
used to determine error rates.
</UL>
By default, features are scored using the Fisher criterion score.

<LI>
-scores &lt;file&gt; - Write to the given file a two-column matrix
containing the computed quality scores for each feature.  The score is
the Fisher score or the negative log<SUB>10</SUB> of the t-test
p-value.

<LI>
-useclassnumber &lt;value&gt; - If the class file contains multiple
classes, use the class indicated by this number. The first column of
class labels is column 1. If this option is omitted, the first column
of classifications is used.

<LI>
-threshtype percent|number|value - Select different means of setting
the feature selection threshold.  The "percent" option chooses the top
n% of the features.  The "number" option chooses the top n features.
The "value" option chooses features that score above n.  The default
setting is "percent".

<LI>
-fthreshold &lt;value&gt; - Set the threshold for feature selection.
The default setting depends upon the threshold type: for "percent" and
"number", the default is 10; for "value" it is 1.

<LI>
-rdb - Allow the program to read and create <A
HREF="http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/research/compbio/rdb/index.html">RDB</A>
formatted files, which contain an additional format line after the
first line of text.

<LI>
-verbose 1|2|3|4|5 - Set the verbosity level of the output to stderr.
The default level is 2.
