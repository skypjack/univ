<P><B>Description:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Fit a sigmoid function to the discriminant values produced by an SVM,
and use the sigmoid to compute probabilities.  This program is based
upon pseudocode given in "Probabilistic outputs for support vector
machines and comparison to regularized likelihood methods" by Platt.

<P>
Typically, to use Gist, you begin with a training set of data, a
corresponding set of labels, and a test set of unannotated data that
you would like to classify.  In order to use this
<CODE>gist-sigmoid</CODE>, follow these steps:
<OL>
<LI>
Divide your set of labeled training data into an SVM training set and
a sigmoid training set.  The sigmoid training set can be smaller than
the SVM training set; for example, you might randomly extract 10% of
your training set to be used in sigmoid training.
<LI>
Run <CODE>compute-weights</CODE> on the SVM training set.
<LI>
Run <CODE>classify</CODE> on the sigmoid training set, using the
weights generated from the SVM training set.
<LI>
Run <CODE>classify</CODE> on the unnannotated set of test data,
also using the weights generated from the SVM training set.  This is
the data set for you would like to get probability estimates.
<LI>
Finally, run <CODE>gist-sigmoid</CODE> using the sigmoid training set
predictions generated by <CODE>classify</CODE>, the true labels of the
sigmoid training set, and the predictions for the unannotated training
set.
</OL>
It is important that the three data sets -- SVM training set, sigmoid
training set, and unannotated test set -- be disjoint.  Otherwise, the
probability estimates that you obtain from <CODE>gist-sigmoid</CODE>
will be skewed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Inputs:</B>
<UL>
<LI>train labels - an SVM label file, similar to the input provided
to compute-weights.
<LI> train predictions - an SVM predictions file corrresponding to the
given train labels, as produced by classify.  Note that, for the
probability estimates to be valid, the sigmoid training set should be
disjoint from the examples used to train the SVM.
<LI> test predictions - an SVM predictions file in which the
discriminant value are to be converted into probabilities.
</UL>

<P><B>Output:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The program prints to standard output a version of the test
predictions file with an additional column.  This column contains
probabilities corresponding to each of the given discriminant values.
The parameters of the sigmoid (A and B) are included in an additional line
at the end of the header.  The formula for converting a discriminant
value X into a probability is 1 / (1 + exp(A * X + B)).  Also, the
second column of the predictions file contains binary class
predictions based upon the probabilities (using a threshold of 50%),
rather than based upon the discriminants.

<P><B>Options:</B> 

<ul>

<li>
<code>-algorithm [platt|lin]</code> Selecting the <code>lin</code>
option activates an alternative optimization routine.  This is based
upon pseduocode provided by Lin and colleages (Lin H, Lin C, Weng R.

Engineering, National Taiwan University, 2003).  This code was
supplied by Michael E. Matheny (mmatheny@dsg.harvard.edu).
