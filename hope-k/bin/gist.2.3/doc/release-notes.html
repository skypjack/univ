<b>Gist Release 2.3</b>, March 22, 2006

<ul>

<li>
Add the <code>-algorithm lin</code> option to
<code>gist-sigmoid</code>.

<li>
Fixed the diffusion kernel in <code>gist-kernel</code>.

<li>
Added the <code>int-dim</code>, <code>simple-diffusion</code> and
<code>modav</code> operations to <code>gist-matrix</code>.

</ul>

<b>Gist Release 2.2</b>, Sep 20, 2005

<ul>
<li>
Added the <code>-hyperplane</code> option to 'gist-train-svm' and
added the corresponding 'gist-fast-classify' program.

<li>
Added the <code>gist-kernel</code> program.

</ul>

<B>Gist Release 2.1</B>, May 3 2004
<ul>
<li>

The main difference between 2.1 and 2.0.9 is the renaming of the
executables.  This means that 'compute-weights' is now
'gist-train-svm' and 'classify' is 'gist-classify'. The new executable
names are documented <a href="index.html">here</a>.


</ul>

<B>Gist Release 2.0.9</B>, May 3 2004 <ul> <li>The Gist system is now
built from code using the GNU build system. This should make it easier
for users on diverse systems use or adapt our code. 

  <li>Minor changes to code to allow compilation on Windows (Cygwin)
and Macintosh OSX. Binaries for these platforms have been added to the
distribution options.

  <li> Added <CODE>-precision</CODE> option to control the number of
  digits after the decimal point in output files.
  
  <li> Included more informative error messages when trying to do
  feature selection on data that has too few positive or negative
  training examples.

  <li> Fixed a minor bug in the <CODE>-widthfactor</CODE> option to
  compute-weights and kernel-pca.  Previously, contrary to what the
  documentation said, the width factor F was applied after squaring
  the width w in the radial basis kernel.  This has been fixed, so
  that F is multiplied by w prior to squaring.

  <li> Added the <CODE>-width</CODE> option to compute-weights and
  kernel-pca, allowing the user to set the radial basis width
  directly.

  <LI> gist-rfe now retains the sign on the feature weights, so that
  you can tell whether the feature occurs more frequently in the
  positive or negative class.
      
</ul>

<B>Gist Release 2.0.8</B>, January 6, 2004
<ul>
  
  <li>classify: Bugs fixed in matrix dimension tests for "self-train"
and "self-test" matrices.
      
  <li>compute-weights: When <code>-kernelout</code> is selected, the
  diagonal factor for the 2-norm soft margin is no longer added. This
  change makes it possible to use compute-weights to generate kernel
  matrices that can be modified externally, and then re-entered for
  training using the <code>-matrix</code> option.

  <li>fselect: The <code>-threshold</code> option has been renamed to
  <code>-fthreshold</code> to agree with compute-weights.
      
</ul>

<B>Gist Release 2.0.7</B>, December 16, 2003
<ul>

  <li>Changed the default value of 'maxiter' (maximum number of
  iterations during training) to 'no limit', from the previous default
  of 10000.  This prevents early termination of jobs that take many
  iterations. Users who want iteration or time limits should set the
  <code>-maxiter</code> or <code>-maxtime</code> options for
  <code>compute-weights</code>.
  
  <li>Fixed minor bug in the array shuffling routine that caused arrays
  to be non-uniformly shuffled.

  <li>Default precision and width in rdb-matrix increased from 5/3 to
  8/5. This reduces problems caused by loss of precision during
  manipulation of files.
      
  <li>Added a Perl script, <CODE>gist-rfe</CODE> to do SVM recursive
  feature elimination.

 </ul>

 <p><B>Gist Release 2.0.6</B> was not released.</p>
 
 <B>Gist Release 2.0.5</B>, April 30, 2003
 <ul>
   
   <li>compute-weights: Fixed bug in 2-norm soft margin implementation
   that caused incorrect use of the diagonal factors in some cases. In
   particular, training errors could be mis-reported in some cases,
   and hold-one-out cross-validation could yield incorrect results in
   some situations.  This only affects applications where the 2-norm
   soft margin was used (that is, with a 'diagonal factor').
       
   <li> score-svm-results: Uninitialized variable bug fixed.

 </ul>
 
 <B>Gist Release 2.0.4</B>, April 3, 2003
 <ul>

   <li>classify: Fixed bug that caused failure when using a non-square
   test kernel matrix.

   <li>classify: Using a training kernel matrix for 'classify' when
   not needed causes a warning to be issued.

   <li>Got rid of dependency on system utilities 'hostname' and
   'date'; UTIL_PATH is no longer needed.

</ul>
 
<B>Gist Release 2.0.3</B>, February 20, 2003
<ul>

  <li>Modification of how system utilities are found; there is a
  UTIL_PATH define that can now be set in the makefile if 'hostname'
  and 'date' are not in the user's path.

  <li>Documentation improvements.
</ul>
 
<B>Gist Release 2.0.2</B>, October 11, 2002

<UL>

<LI>
Modify fit-sigmoid so that it takes three inputs: a training set of
predictions for fitting the sigmoid, the corresponding labels, and a
test set of predictions that are to be converted to probabilities.
Note that, for the curve fit to be valid, the sigmoid training set
should be distinct from the set used to train the SVM.

<LI>Fixed bug in normal approximation to Mann-Whitney U test p-value
calculation.

</UL>

<B>Gist Release 2.0.1</B>, August 14, 2002

<UL>
<LI>
Modify compute-weights so that the default parameters are reasonable:
use a 2-norm soft margin with a diagonal factor of 0.1; turn
normalization on; use a constant factor of 10.
</UL>


<B>Gist Release 2.0</B>, July 24, 2002

<UL>
<LI>
Rename the entire package.

<LI>
Add <CODE>kernel-pca</CODE>, <CODE>project</CODE>,
<CODE>fit-sigmoid</CODE>, <CODE>fselect</CODE> and
<CODE>score-svm-results</CODE> programs.

<LI>
Add many feature selection options to <CODE>compute-weights</CODE>.

<LI>
Add many options to <CODE>rdb-matrix</CODE>.

<LI>
Improve I/O error checking.

<LI>
Generalize label file format to allow multiple classes in one file.

</UL>

<B>svm Release 1.2</B>, August 21, 2001

<UL>

<LI>
Add <CODE>-rdb</CODE> option to <CODE>compute-weights</CODE> and
<CODE>classify</CODE>, and make the default behavior to not expect or
produce RDB format lines.

<LI>
Fix bug in shuffling routine used in selecting order of evaluation of
examples during training and hold-one-out testing.  This change will
not affect the output of the program, but may affect the speed of
convergence.

<LI>
Add <CODE>-maxiter</CODE> option to <CODE>compute-weights</CODE>.

<LI>
Add <CODE>-holdout</CODE> option to <CODE>compute-weights</CODE>.

<LI>
Scale precision of weights output depending upon convergence
threshold.

<LI>
Add <CODE>-initial</CODE> option to <CODE>compute-weights</CODE>.

</UL>

<B>svm Release 1.1</B>, July, 2000.

<UL>

<LI>
Add <CODE>-adddiag</CODE> option to <CODE>compute-weights</CODE>.

<LI>
Add <CODE>-zeromean</CODE> and <CODE>-varone</CODE> options to
<CODE>compute-weights</CODE>.

<LI>
Add a secondary optimization of only the support vectors.

<LI>
Make the convergence threshold depend upon the number of examples.

</UL>

<B>svm Release 1.0</B>, September 23, 1999.

<UL>

<LI>
Fix bug in weight update routine.

<LI>
Include median kernel value in diagonal factor heuristic.

<LI>
Add the constant factor back in after diagonalizing.

<LI>
Fix bug in the way polynomialization was done.

</UL>

<B>svm Release 0.95</B>, August 30, 1999.

<UL>

<LI>
Change the normalization routines to operate on the kernel, rather than
the data.  This makes the normalization appropriate for any kernel.

<LI>
Generalize the radial kernel to work as a transformation of any kernel
function.

<LI>
Remove the covariance kernel and the sigmoid kernel.

<LI>
Switch the way polynomialization works.  It is now A(K +
B))<SUP>C</SUP>, rather than ((AK) + B)<SUP>C</SUP>.

</UL>

<B>svm Release 0.9</B>, August 16, 1999.
