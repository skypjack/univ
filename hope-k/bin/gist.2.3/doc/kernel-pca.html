<P><B>Description:</B> Compute kernel-based eigenvectors for a set of
training examples.</P>

<P><B>Usage:</B> gist-kpca [options] -train &lt;filename&gt;</P>

<P><B>Input:</B> 
<UL> 
<LI> -train &lt;filename&gt; - a tab-delimited, labeled file of
training examples.  The first column contains labels, and the
remaining columns containing real-valued features.
</UL>

<P><B>Output:</B> A tab-delimited matrix in which each column
corresponds to an eigenvector.  Eigenvectors are normalized so that
the dot product of the eigenvector with itself equals the reciprocal
of the corresponding eigenvalue.  In the output, the eigenvectors are
sorted by increasing magnitude.</P>

<P><B>Options:</B>

<UL>

<LI> -zeromean - Subtract from each element in the input data the mean
of the elements in that row, giving the row a mean of zero.

<LI> -varone - Divide each element in the input data by the standard
deviation of the elements in that row, giving the row a variance of
one.

</UL>


<p>By default, the base kernel function is a dot product.  In this
case, the kernel-pca will give the same results as a 'standard'
principal component analysis. If desired, this kernel can be modified
using the following options.  The operations occur in the order listed
below.</p>

<UL>

<LI> -nocenter - PCA requires a centered matrix, in which the sum of
each column is zero.  This centering operation can be performed in
kernel space, and is done by default.  The <CODE>-nocenter</CODE>
option disables this operation.  This option is only useful in
conjunction with the <CODE>-kernelout</CODE> operation, to produce an
intermediate matrix.</li>

<LI> -adddiag &lt;value&gt; - Add the given value to the diagonal of
the kernel matrix.</li>

<LI> -nonormalize - Do not normalize the kernel matrix.  By default,
the matrix is normalized by dividing K(x,y) by sqrt(K(x,x) * K(y,y)).</li>

<LI> -constant &lt;value&gt; - Add a given constant to the kernel.
The default constant is 10.</li>

<LI> -coefficient &lt;value&gt; - Multiply the kernel by a given
coefficient.  The default coefficient is 1.</li>

<LI> -power &lt;value&gt; - Raise the kernel to a given power.  The
default power is 1.</li>

<LI> -radial - Convert the kernel to a radial basis function.  If K is
the base kernel, this option creates a kernel of the form
exp[(-D(x,y)<SUP>2</SUP>)/(2 w<SUP>2</SUP>)], where w is the width of
the kernel (see below) and D(x,y) is the distance between x and y,
defined as D(x,y) = sqrt[K(x,x)<SUP>2</SUP> - 2 K(x,y) +
K(y,y)<SUP>2</SUP>].</li>

<LI> -widthfactor &lt;value&gt; - The width w of the radial basis
kernel is set using a heuristic: it is the median of the distance from
each training point to the nearest training point.  This option
specifies a multiplicative factor to be applied to that width.  The
default is a width factor of 1.</li>

<LI> -width &lt;value&gt; - Directly set the width w of the radial
basis kernel.  If set, this option overrides the -widthfactor
option.</LI>

</ul>


   <p>If the supplied kernel functions are insufficient, the user can
supply as input a precalculated kernel matrix using the following option</p>

 <ul>
    
<LI> -matrix - By default, the base kernel function is a dot product.
This option allows that function to be replaced by an arbitrary
function supplied by the user (for many commonly used kernels, see the
options listed above).  If supplied, the software reads kernel values,
rather than raw feature data, from the file specified by
<code>-train</code>.  The matrix must be an n+1 by n+1 tab-delimited
matrix, where n is the number of training examples.  The first row and
column contain data labels.  The matrix entry for row x, column y,
contains the kernel value K(x,y).</li>
    
    </ul>


<p>The remaining options (except for -rdb) affect the output of the software.</p>

      <ul>
<LI> -numeigens &lt;value&gt; - Include in the output at most the
specified number of eigenvectors (subject to the next constraint).
By default, all are included.

<LI> -eigenthresh &lt;value&gt; - Include in the output only
eigenvectors whose corresponding eigenvalues are greater than the
specified value.  Default value is zero (all eigenvectors).

<LI> -eigenvalues &lt;file&gt; - Create a file with the given name and
store the eigenvalues there as a space-separated array of numbers.

<LI> -rdb - Allow the program to read and create <A
HREF="http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/research/compbio/rdb/index.html">RDB</A>
formatted files, which contain an additional format line after the
first line of text.

<LI> -kernelout - Compute and print the kernel matrix to stdout.  Do
not compute the eigenvectors.

<LI> -notime - Do not include timing information in the output header.

<li> -precision &lt;value&gt; - Number of digits after the decimal
place in the output file.  The default is 6.

<LI> -verbose 1|2|3|4|5 - Set the verbosity level of the output to
stderr.  The default level is 2.
</UL>
