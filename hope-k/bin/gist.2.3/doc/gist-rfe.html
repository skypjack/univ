<P><B>Description:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Perform recursive feature elimination, following
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I. Guyon, J. Weston, S. Barnhill and V. Vapnik. "Gene selection for
cancer classification using support vector machines." <I>Machine
Learning</I>. 46(1-3):389-422, 2002.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
This is an algorithm for selecting a subset of features for a
particular learning task.  The basic algorithm is the following:<BR>
<BR>
<OL>
<LI> Initialize the data set to contain all features.
<LI> Train an SVM on the data set.
<LI> Rank features according to c<SUB>i</SUB> = (w<SUB>i</SUB>)<SUP>2</SUP>.
<LI> Eliminate the lower-ranked 50% of the features.
<LI> If more than one feature remains, return to step 2.
</OL>

<P>
When using this algorithm, beware of incurring a selection bias.  For
details, see

the basis of microarray gene-expression data." <I>PNAS</I>.

<P><B>Usage:</B> <CODE>gist-rfe [options] &lt;train&nbsp;data&gt;
&lt;train&nbsp;labels&gt;</CODE>


<P><B>Inputs:</B>
<UL>
<LI> train data - a data file suitable for input to
<CODE>compute-weights</CODE>
<LI> train labels - the corresponding label file
</UL>

<P><B>Output:</B>
<UL>

  Prints to standard output the performance evaluation (as produced by
  <CODE>score-svm-results</CODE>) at each iteration of the SVM-RFE
  algorithm.  By default, evaluates the performance using
  leave-one-out cross-validation.  The <CODE>-test</CODE> option
  enables evaluation on an independent test set.

</UL>



<P><B>Options:</B>
<UL>

<LI> -test &lt;data&gt; &lt;labels&gt; - Evaluate performance
with respect to an external test set.

<LI> -rfe-iter &lt;value&gt; - Perform a maximum number of iterations
of RFE.  By default, the algorithm continues until all features are
eliminated.

<LI> -reduce &lt;percent&gt; - Percent of training set to eliminate
each round.  At least one feaure will always be removed.  Default = 50.

<LI> -features &lt;file&gt; - File in which to print the features
selected at each iteration.  The output is in four columns: feature
name, iteration, score (c<SUB>i</SUB>) and a binary value indicating
whether the feature was discarded in this iteration.  If the filename
contains a <CODE>%</CODE>, then multiple output files will be created,
replacing <CODE>%</CODE> with the iteration number.

<LI> -weights &lt;file&gt; - File in which to store weights.  The same
use of <CODE>%</CODE> applies.

<LI> -predicts &lt;file&gt; - File in which to store predictions.  The same
use of <CODE>%</CODE> applies.

<P>
In addition, any option that is valid for <CODE>gist-train-svm</CODE>
may also be given to SVM-RFE.
