Description
===========

This package defines two environments for typesetting algorithms in
LaTeX2e.  Lines are automatically numbered and can be referenced,
the means for easy indentation is provided, and algorithms can be made
floating bodies if desired.


Installation
============

Run LaTeX2e on the file alg.ins to generate the file alg.sty.  After
this is done, you can generate the documentation by running LaTeX2e
twice on the file alg.dtx.

You'll probably want to move the file alg.sty to a directory included
in your $TEXINPUTS environment variable.
