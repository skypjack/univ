--- README FILE ---

the jar file nnsecclient.jar contains the client side classes of the nnsec
project, useful to start the client part of the system.
Reading the following sections is suggested for users that are new to nnsec.



--- THE TRUSTSTORE ---

What users need is to create a truststore (as shown in the JSSE Reference Guide)
suitable for use with JSSE. This is because client and server communicate using
a SSL tunnel. In fact, servers have to make a keyEntry in their keystore, so
that they can submit a certificate to the clients. Then, clients can make a
corresponding trustedCertEntry (public key only) into them truststore.


Once that you have received a valid certificate from a server, following steps
have to be done:

1 - Import the certificate into a new truststore.

      % keytool -import -alias nnseccert -file nnsec.cer -keystore truststore

      Enter keystore password:  trustword
      Owner: CN=Michele Caini, OU=lci, O=unifi, L=Florence, ST=FI, C=IT
      Issuer: CN=Michele Caini, OU=lci, O=unifi, L=Florence, ST=FI, C=IT
      Serial number: 46e29d22
      Valid from: Sat Sep 08 15:01:22 CEST 2007 until: Fri Dec 07 14:01:22 CEST
      2007
      Certificate fingerprints:
        MD5: 76:8B:9E:4A:E3:5A:00:AE:65:8E:B5:DF:47:FE:E7:06
	SHA1: 9C:0F:C8:DC:C8:5E:CC:CD:25:94:E4:A4:F3:70:14:85:7C:9C:A3:8E
      Trust this certificate? [no]:  yes
      Certificate was added to keystore



--- TEST-ONLY PROVIDED FILES ---

Provided with the jar file you can see that there are two files (other than that
README file). These are test-files that you can use trying the client, but there
is absolutely no warranty with these files. Use them at your own risk.



--- COMMAND LINE ---

Once that the truststore is ready to be used, you can run the client. Simply,
type:

    % java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=truststore \
            -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=nnsects -jar nnsecclient.jar


Clearly, you have to change the truststore/nnsects entries if you have assigned
different name to the file or if you have used a different password for the
truststore.
